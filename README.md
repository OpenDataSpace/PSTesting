PSTesting
=========
Lightweight framework to simplify unit testing of Powershell and Pash related functionality.

Prerequisites
-------------
If using on unix systems, please run `update_pash.sh` to get a copy of Pash into this repository
from a local clone. Otherwise make sure the `System.Managamenet.Automation.dll` is either located
at `Libraries/Pash` or in the global assembly cache (GAC).

On Windows this assembly should be in the GAC by default, so no need to worry.
